## Help yourself

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tech_support_cheat_sheet.png)

  - Carefully read the error message. Often it won’t help, but sometimes
    there are hints that will help you get started.

  - If you encounter an error message you don’t understand, strip
    anything highly specific (like your object or variable names),
    surround it with quotes and **google** it\!
    
    (If the error message isn’t in English, run `Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE =
    "en")` and re-run the code; you’re more likely to find help for
    English error messages.)

  - Search [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and include the
    `[r]` tag. Or the `[ggplot2]` tag. Or the `[dplyr]` tag. You get the
    idea.

## Get help from others

If you do get to help from others, strive to create a **reprex**, a
minimal reproducible example. There are three things you need to include
to make your example reproducible: required packages, data, and code.

1.  **Packages** should be loaded at the top of the script, so it’s easy
    to see which ones the example needs. This is a good time to check
    that you’re using the latest version of each package; it’s possible
    you’ve discovered a bug that’s been fixed since you installed the
    package. For packages in the tidyverse, the easiest way to check is
    to run `tidyverse_update()`.

2.  The easiest way to include **data** in a question is to use `dput()`
    to generate the R code to recreate it. For example, to recreate the
    `mtcars` dataset in R, I’d perform the following steps:
    
    1.  Run `dput(mtcars)` in R
    2.  Copy the output
    3.  In my reproducible script, type `mtcars <-` then paste.
    
    Try and find the smallest subset of your data that still reveals the
    problem.

3.  Spend a little bit of time ensuring that your **code** is easy for
    others to read:
    
      - Make sure you’ve used spaces and your variable names are
        concise, yet informative.
    
      - Use comments to indicate where your problem lies.
    
      - Do your best to remove everything that is not related to the
        problem.  
        The shorter your code is, the easier it is to understand, and
        the easier it is to fix.

In the process of preparing your own reprex, you’ll often find that you
answer your own question. So it is a useful exercise even if you aren’t
ready to call in the experts yet. The process of stripping your problem
down to its bare essence often reveals where the root issue lies.
